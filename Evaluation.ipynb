This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of- nature. Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science. For example: why does the universe exist at all? After all, the time-space world didn't have to exist. Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos? These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source. |> We are _just_ animals.

When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will. And one the requires a kind of \"faith\" too. By taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own. But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by reading Paul Johnson's \"A History of Christianity\". From your remarks, it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others. Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and be animated by some enduring values. With best wishes,\n",

Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care. Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.) This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.

By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes. As far as healing goes. If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels. In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today. Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better. -> Niether was he a lunatic.

The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily. I live in fear of what will happen when I die. I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus. I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions.. I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory. <<****Strong opinions start here...****>> 1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable. (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real. Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false. Christianity is an infectious cult. The reasons it flourishes are because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind. \"Oh wow..all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\" For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\" but i digress... The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature. A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word. We are _just_ animals. We need sleep, food, and we reproduce. And we die. Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality. Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high. It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part. When Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day. Jesus was just prophet #37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses (no encryption). Send mail to help@penet.fi for information. Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19): pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions.

Notes ===== - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues are wholly unresolved. - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP software (see the question on cryptography). - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies) vary between sites. - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time. _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity? Users ----- - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others. - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others. - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet, such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups. - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations. Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic. - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt' hierarchy is preferred. - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e. references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle. - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n",

The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared. The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace. The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half. The Rangers predictably took a dive. That shouldn't have surprised anybody. Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals. They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in June. The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little. But for the most part things were as expected.

I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . . Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, telling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle Sabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their apartment. I didn't see Karina,\n",

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK,\n",

And so end the mockery. Gain knowledge of the real God. Put your presumptions aside. Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience. A person who commits himself to seeking God, will find God. Jesus stands at your door and knocks. But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing. The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly. Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd. Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. I will personally guarantee that one.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the \"Introduction to Atheism\"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting. These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point. Overview of contents: \"What is the purpose of this newsgroup?\" \"Hitler was an atheist!\" \"The Bible proves it\" \"Pascal's Wager\" \"What is Occam's Razor?\" \"Why it's good to believe in Jesus\" \"Why I know that God exists\" \"Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\" \"Everyone worships something\" \"Why there must be a causeless cause\" \"The universe is so complex it must have been designed\" \"Independent evidence that the Bible is true\" \"Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\" \"George Bush on atheism and patriotism\" \"I know where hell is!\" \"Biblical contradictions wanted\" \"The USA is a Christian nation\" \"The USA is not a Christian nation\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup? Typical posting: Why have a newsgroup about atheism? Why do atheists organize in groups? What is there to discuss? Response: Many things are discussed here, including: * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert. Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings. ------------------------------ Subject: Hitler was an atheist! Typical posting: Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did! Response: Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist. As he said himself: The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_ superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_ not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.] For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will. Therefore, let every man be active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other.

      "Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- An Introduction to Atheism by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism. Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint. I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article. To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist. All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created. Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article. Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint. This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism. So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being. Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not. \"What is atheism?\" Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist. The former is often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong atheism\". It is important to note the difference between these two positions. \"Weak atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God. \"Strong atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist. Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\". Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials. \"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\" Definitely not. Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true. Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not. Which brings us to agnosticism. \"What is agnosticism then?\" The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876. He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable. Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists. Words are slippery things, and language is inexact. Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic. For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\",\n",

Users ----- - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others. - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others. - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet, such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups. - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations. Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic. - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt' hierarchy is preferred. - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e. references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle. - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n",

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets. But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone. It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare. It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.

I have often wondered about this. I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk. A good, inpenatrable military target. The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be. But I digress. Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb. Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum. Therefore the second bomb was dropped. Most unfortunate, IMO. > >> I, for one, don't regret it. > > Nuke a Jap for Jesus! > I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow >it blindly? Why do we follow God so blindly? Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot. I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind. I see, but I see illusions as well as reality. (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth. (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.) Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy. So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God. Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie. That is why we need faith to be saved. We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know. Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world? I also do trust my experiences to some extent. When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time. This is where our works as Christians are important: As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong. As for you, no one can \"convert\" you. You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him. All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God. If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you. If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally. Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world. May the Lord bring peace to you,\n",

      "Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4 Constructing a Logical Argument Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor. This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate. Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED]. Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid). Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument. Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable. The matter is very much open for debate. This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job. Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is raining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\". Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false). Note that this is a technical meaning of \"deny\", not the everyday meaning. The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it. So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a God\" both express the same proposition. An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\". An argument consists of three stages. First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated. These are called the premises of the argument. They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\", \"since\", \"obviously\" and so on. (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises. If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it. You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when you've heard the explanation.) Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference. In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted. There are various forms of valid inference. The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference. Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or \"therefore\". Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference. Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\" and so on. The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference. For example: Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a\n",

      "From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46 The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak ------------------------------------ \"On the ancient peak of Ararat The centuries have come like seconds And passed on.\" -Avetik Issahakian by Yuri Danilov Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \"What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\" And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems. Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \"numbers\" (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers.\" Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back. One for the \"road\" They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley. The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History of Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\" thought the Royal Astronomer. --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century\n",

No Muslim left alive - not a single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \"Murad\", especially ordering that 'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children also should be killed as they form a danger to the Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1] [1] M. Varandian, \"History of the Dashnaktsutiun,\" p. 85. Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush. In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in April 21, 1915, \"thanking it for its services to Russia.\" The Armenian newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly reported in May 24, 1915 that \"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\" Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918. University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13. \"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" (See also Map 1.

Good point -- it is very true that these \"false\" predictions are dangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets. However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let those who falsly report such \"visions\" as a reason against believing in any of them (I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole). Example: The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917. Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism (something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik revolution). She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who was not the current one. It happened just like she said.) She warned there would be \"fire in the sky\" as a warning that the second world war was about to start. About a week before Germany invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever recorded. To this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's prediction simply coincidence. You all can decide for yourselves. Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all over the world and persecute religion. She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here. Every single one has been realized. One can only use the term \"coincidence\" so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous. SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There are true ones, too. We must always remain open to\n",

      "A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God: > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, > and unworthy of my worship or faith. Nobuya \"Higgy\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others): > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's > behavior? It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions. Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of Sodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says: + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing! There are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever God happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning. It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general. Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result. When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity. (Origen said: \"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\") Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument\n",

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is \"What is the DoD?\", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be \"How do I get a DoD number?\" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.) Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too. By now you're probably asking \"So who's the KotL already?\". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \"secret\" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie mailers\").\n",

I look forward to it. The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis have forgotten) is \"I do not care if you are either a man or a woman, I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay or straight.\" Once you can honistly say \"I do not care about color, race, or gender or sexual preference\", then we will truly be on the right track. Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along? Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female, or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour. But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say \"I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences; I instend instead to treat you as a human being,\" crap like last year's riots will continue to happen. >1.

Obviously, if a \"truth\" is not always \"true\" then we have a >> contradiction in terms. I agree with Carol here. Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time. And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative. For example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature does water boil at?\" I got the answer 212 degrees consistently. I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees. Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\" Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong. IT is NOT an absolute truth. Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point. Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO. [example of head-covering in Church deleted] This was a good example. There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me? No. And I see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be. >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth. (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this? Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.

But do you really believe that this is the reason ? |> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it |> serves no other purpose ? A number of points. You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used. True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them. For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card. The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer. This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week. There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario. In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially. |> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that |> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were |> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'.
